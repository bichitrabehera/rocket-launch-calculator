# ðŸš€ Rocket Launch Calculator

A **Streamlit-based** interactive app that calculates a rocketâ€™s acceleration, final velocity, and estimated height reached based on user input.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
- **User Inputs:** Rocket mass (kg), thrust (N), and burn time (seconds).
- **Physics Calculations:**
  - Acceleration = (Thrust âˆ’ Weight) / Mass
  - Final Velocity = Acceleration Ã— Burn Time
  - Height = 0.5 Ã— Acceleration Ã— Burn TimeÂ²
- **Instant Results:** Displays calculated acceleration, velocity, and height.
